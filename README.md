I love SignalR. I think it's one of the best tools for developers Microsoft created.
However, there were not a lot of potential application points for it on my commercial project.
At the same time, I didn't want to create another chat which is always a use case when learning anything WebSocket-related.
Being inspired by one of SignalR demos, I decided to build a simple app, which resembled an old NES game called Duck Hunt.
I called this thing a Div Hunt, because a player has to track moving objects (represented by divs in HTML) with their phone.
Unfortunately, there is still minimal of SignalR, but the result is so much fun
